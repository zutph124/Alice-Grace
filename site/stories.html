<span>T</span>he legend of the Barcelos Rooster, a symbol that stands for honesty, integrity, trust and honor.
<br>
<br>
The people of Barcelos had been shaken by a crime for which a pilgrim was the prime suspect. He was tried and the judge sentenced him to death by hanging but the pilgram, insisting on his innocence, as his last wish asked to be brought again before the judge, who was already dining. 
Then, pointing at the roast cock, that had been served up to the judge, the pilgrim stated: "I swear that I am innocent that when you hang me, this cock is going to crow". 
The judge ignored the appeal but just as the noose was tightening around the neck of the pilgrim, the cock raised its head off the table and crowed loudly. the pilgrim was spared and sent on his way in peace.
