<span>O</span>ur trips to Portugal started way back in 2005.
For the last 10 years we have visited aunty Alice every August on her birthday.
The first couple of trips I went alone. Soon afterwards, Angela and aunty Bunty joined,
and later on, Aaltje and Dino. Over the years, various family members made the annual trip.
In August 2014, a total of nine family members attended the momentous occassion of the
100th birthday of aunty Alice.
</p>
<p><span>A</span>unty Alice had many characteristics, she was <i>intelligent, generous, well-dressed, stern, steadfast</i>. 
She loved Christ, her Baptist church, family and friends. 
In her early years, she travelled across europe and made several trips to Africa visiting family. 
When we visited Portugal, she enjoyed the numerous road trips we made and dining out.
Aunty Alice liked the &quot;finer things in life&quot;, was a good storyteller that captivated her audience
when she told a story.
</p> 
<p><span>L</span>ooking back, we have had some fun times in Portugal, 
enjoyed the nice food and vinho, and meet some good people like Alcina, Manual and Louisa
- loving and caring friends of aunty Alice. Finding Dino's family was a major happening of our Portuguese adventure, they welcomed us all and their hospitality was fabulous and heart-warming.  Here are some of the highlights of our visits and a selection of photographs from aunty Alice's albums.
